# dice_web_app
Dice rolling web app created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
Created through Dr. Angela's Udemy Web Development Course 

The app manipulates element attributes in the DOM using JavaScript. 

In order to play, refresh the web page.  

The dice rolls are randomly generated integers using Math.floor and Math.random. The results are saved as variables. 
Then, to choose a random image, each variable is concacted with the image tag's source template string to select the corresponding dice roll image.

If Player One's Dice Roll is higher, Player One Wins.
If Player Two's Dice Roll is higher, Player Two Wins. 
If both rolls are the same, it is a tie!
